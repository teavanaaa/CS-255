# CS-255

The DriverPass project revolved around a client who wanted to take advantage of a void in the driving instruction market. The client's local DMV did not have a program for training new drivers. They wanted to make an application that allows students to take online training and practice tests and has the ability to schedule in-person driving lessons.
   

I feel that I did particularly well gathering all of the functional and non-functional requirements and explaining them. This is an important part of designing any system. It can act as a guideline to follow while designing the system to help keep the client's needs and wants in mind. I feel as though I did a thorough and sufficient job on this aspect of this series of projects. 
   

If I could choose one part of my work on these documents to revise, it would be all of the UML diagrams and the Gannt chart. I think I could have done a more comprehensive job on all of these. I did my best to keep them as simple as possible while including all of the necessary information, but I feel I could have made them significantly more detailed. 
   

I interpreted the user's needs by reviewing the interview several times and documenting several sections of the necessary information. For example, the purpose, objectives, requirements, etc. All of these aspects of the system can be gathered from speaking to the client and asking clarifying questions. I implemented the user's needs by keeping this information ready and available to reference at all times to ensure that all needs were met. It is important to keep the client's needs in mind because the system is being designed for them. If their needs are not met, then the entire purpose of designing the system has not been met. 
   

When designing software, it is important to gather as much information as possible, organize it, and then present this information to the client to ensure that all of their desires are recorded and will be met. Then, the process of building the system can begin. Conversing and keeping communication open with the client during this process is valuable. Once the system is tested and accepted by the team and client, it can be implemented and maintained/improved on a regular basis.
