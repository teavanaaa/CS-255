1. Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project revolved around a client who wanted to take advantage of a void in the driving instruction market. The client's local DMV did not have a program for training new drivers. They wanted to make an application that allows students to tke online training, practice tests, and have the ability to schedule in-person driving lessons.
   
2. What did you do particularly well?
Something I feel that I did particularly well was gathering all of the functional and nonfunctional requirements, and explaining them. This is an important part of designing any system. It can act as a guideline to follow while designing the system to help keep the client's needs and wants in mind. I feel as though I did a thorough and sufficient job on this aspect of this series of projects. 
   
3. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one part of my work on these douments to revise, it would be all of the UML diagrams nd the Gannt chart. I think I could have done a more compehensive job on all of these. I did my best to keep them as simple as possible while also incuding all of the necessary information, but I feel as though I could have made them significantly more detailed. 
   
4. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by reviewing the interview several times and documenting several sections of necessary information. For example, the purpose, ojectives, requirements, etc. All of these aspects of the system can be gathered from speaking to the client and asking clarifying questions. I implemented the user's needs by keeping ths information ready and availabe to eference at all times to ensure that all of the needs are being met. 
   
5. How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software, it is important to gather as much information as possible, organize it, and then present this information to the client to assure that all of their desires are recorded and will be met. Then, the process of building the system can begin. It is valuable to converse and keep communication open with the clent during this entire process. Once the system is tested and accepted by the team and client, it can be implemented and maintained/improved on a regular basis.
